Aramco Internship
During my internship, I contributed to updating the BatPaC model and developed automated analysis workflows using Python. Due to confidentiality and NDA restrictions, I have provided pseudocode for the analytical components of the project to demonstrate my approach and methodology.

Key Contributions
Enhanced the BatPaC model with updated parameters and calculations to reflect industry trends.
Automated data analysis and visualization pipelines, improving efficiency and accuracy.
Conducted detailed cost comparisons and trend analyses for cathodes and batteries across multiple regions.
